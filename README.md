# refactor-project

## Description

This is an exercise in HTML semantics and writing efficient CSS code. Given preexisting code for the client's homepage, my task is to clean it up by eliminating CSS redundancies, modifying HTML tags to reflect a well-ordered semantic structure, and debugging broken features. Below is a screenshot showing some of the page's body content.

## Usage

Owing to my edits, this modified code should be significantly easier to work with for future development. Open DevTools in Google Chrome to see notes on the modifications made and the rationale behind them. To view the deployed page, [click here](https://altavada.github.io/samt-refactor-project/).

## Credits

Credits to [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4216035/css-background-image-alt-attribute) for introducing me to the "title" attribute for describing an image rendered as the background-image property of a CSS class. Dear instructors, I'd love some feedback on the viability of this method. This was by far the most popular response in that SO thread, but there was some debate about whether it was really a fix-all solution for accessibility purposes. It seems that using "background-image" is not the best practice for any image you want to have a text description attached to it, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway.
